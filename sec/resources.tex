\section{Resources}
The following resources have been identified in order of relevance to achieve the proposed research aims and objectives:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Access to NTG basal wedge historical data.

\item Access to the QLD RSC's super computer for processing, masking and downloading of required Landsat derived data (surface reflectance, FC etc.) which correspond to historical basal point data.
  
\item Access to Grant Staben's Landsat derived CH model \cite{stabenetal2018}, and WFPC algorithm \cite{staben2016}.
  
\item Storage space on the NTG's remote server (PGB-BAS14) to store, process and analyses approximately ($100 \ - \ 150 \ GB$) of data.

\item Access to field equipment to collect additional basal counts where required. 

\end{enumerate}
